Predictive modeling is a process that uses data mining and probability to forecast outcomes. Each model is 
made up of a number of predictors, which are variables that are likely to influence future results. 
Once data has been collected for relevant predictors, a statistical model is formulated. The model may employ a simple linear equation,
or it may be a complex neural network, mapped out by sophisticated software. As additional data becomes available, the statistical 
analysis model is validated or revised.
